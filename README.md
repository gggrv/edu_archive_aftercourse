## Contents

Several quick minimalistic domain-specific experiments/cheatsheets that were made out of neccessity, illustrate  basic syntax/usage of certain tools and do not explicitly serve any high-level purpose.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Status | ‚úîÔ∏èFunctional.<br>üò¥Archived, outdated, no longer maintained.<br>ü§°Throwaway. |
| Reasoning | Due to modern consumer-oriented click-to-run LLM models/toolsets release (for example <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://lmstudio.ai">LM Studio</a>, <a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a> etc), one of the best* ways to find, choose and start using a completely unfamiliar toolset for a given domain-specific problem is to prompt the appropriately-trained model:<br>"`X` in `Y` does `Z`, is my understanding correct?"<br>"In `X` there is `Y`. How to do `Z` using this `Y`? Explain the concept/approach."<br>"List alternatives to `Y`, explain why they exist, provide comparative overview."<br><sub>* Depends on the applicable regulations/requirements.</em></sub> |
| Purpose | Host an archive with working code. |
| Name | <p><sub>*This description was enhanced with the aid of an AI assistant.*</sub></p><p>An `aftercourse` is a small, refreshing palate-cleansing dish that people usually enjoy after finishing the main course.</p> In this unique scenario, a `heavy main course dish` corresponds to a detailed tutorial about an unfamiliar topic; a `light enjoyable aftercourse dish` corresponds to an informal minimalistic extract that can be quickly consumed. |
